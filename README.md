Introduction
The Java Calculator is an interactive calculator application developed using Java and Swing, offering a user-friendly graphical interface for performing basic arithmetic calculations. This comprehensive documentation delves deeply into the code's architecture, the purpose of its individual components, and the intricate logic governing its functionality. It provides a thorough understanding of how the calculator works and handles various user interactions.
Code Structure
The code is organized within a class named calculatorJava, which implements the ActionListener interface to effectively respond to user actions and events. The code constructs a graphical user interface (GUI) for a fundamental calculator with numerous features. It comprises several key components and functional elements, each playing a critical role in the calculator's operation.
Components
1.	JFrame frame: This serves as the central window of the calculator application, encapsulating all other GUI components. It provides the primary user interface for interaction.
2.	JTextField textfield: The textfield functions as the central display area where user input is received and calculation results are presented. It is a fundamental component for providing real-time feedback to the user.
3.	JButton[] numberButtons: An array of buttons, each representing numeric values from 0 to 9, allows users to input numerical data with ease.
4.	JButton[] functionsButton: Another array of buttons is designed to perform various functions, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, decimal input, and more.
5.	Individual JButton instances facilitate additional functionalities like clearing the display, deleting characters, and changing the sign of a number.
6.	Font myFont: A custom font is applied to the text displayed on the calculator, enhancing its visual appeal and user experience.
7.	Several variables are employed to store temporary values, including the numbers entered and the selected operators for subsequent calculations.
Initialization
The code is responsible for the initialization and setup of the GUI components, a process that ensures the calculator operates effectively. The following steps are taken during initialization:
•	Main JFrame Creation: The code constructs the primary JFrame, configures properties such as the window's title, dimensions, and the close operation to ensure a graceful shutdown of the application.
•	Textfield Configuration: The JTextField for display is created, and its dimensions are defined. It is configured as non-editable to prevent direct user input, ensuring that the textfield serves solely as an output display.
•	Button Generation: Buttons for arithmetic operations, numeric input, and additional functionalities are generated. Each button is customized with the custom font and set as non-focusable to maintain a clean and uncluttered user interface.
Event Handling
Event handling is the linchpin of the calculator's functionality. By implementing the ActionListener interface, the code adeptly captures and responds to user interactions. Here's a detailed exploration of how the code handles various events:
•	Number Buttons: Each numeric button appends its respective value to the textfield, allowing users to input numbers conveniently and intuitively.
•	Arithmetic Operator Buttons: When an operator button (e.g., +, -, *, /) is clicked, the code stores the first number entered and the selected operator, preparing for subsequent calculations.
•	Equals Button: The equals button serves as the trigger for the calculation process. It extracts the second number entered, performs the operation based on the selected operator, and displays the result in the textfield. Importantly, it ensures that operator precedence is maintained for accurate calculations.
•	Clear and Delete Buttons: These buttons offer users the means to interact with the application effectively. The clear button erases the entire input, providing a fresh starting point for new calculations. The delete button allows users to remove the last character from the input, facilitating corrections and adjustments.
•	Negation Button: The negation button provides a simple yet valuable feature, enabling users to toggle the sign of a number. This functionality is particularly useful for managing both positive and negative values during calculations.
Operations
The calculator supports four fundamental arithmetic operations, each handled with precision:
1.	Addition (+): The addition button allows users to perform addition operations by clicking it. The code captures the first number entered and stores the addition operator, preparing for the subsequent input of the second number.
2.	Subtraction (-): Subtraction is facilitated in a similar manner. The code captures the first number and the subtraction operator, awaiting the user's input of the second number for accurate results.
3.	Multiplication (*): For multiplication, the code extracts the first number and the multiplication operator, ensuring that the second number is entered to perform the calculation.
4.	Division (/): The code handles division with precision. It captures the first number and the division operator, prompting the user to enter the second number. Importantly, the code takes precautions to prevent division by zero, which is mathematically undefined.
Usage
To make effective use of the Java Calculator, follow these straightforward steps:
1.	Create an instance of the calculatorJava class by invoking its constructor. This is the entry point for running the calculator.
2.	Upon execution, the calculator's graphical user interface will be displayed, providing users with a familiar calculator experience that is easy to navigate.
3.	Interact with the calculator by clicking on the buttons to input numbers, select arithmetic operations, and view calculation results in the textfield. The code provides immediate feedback to users, making it simple to perform a wide range of calculations.
Conclusion
The Java Calculator is a well-crafted, versatile, and functional application that demonstrates the power of Java and the Swing library for developing graphical user interfaces. This extensive documentation has delved deeply into the code's architecture, the roles of its components, and the detailed logic governing its operation. It is worth noting that for an even more thorough understanding of the code, including specific implementation details and comments within the code, can be beneficial. Additionally, this application provides a solid foundation for further enhancements and customization to create more advanced calculator functionalities.
This comprehensive documentation aims to provide a deeper insight into the code's structure and operation while remaining accessible to a broad audience, including developers interested in Java programming and GUI development.
